## Project Overview
Need to develop a model to classify patients' gut microbiota status into three categories ('Optimal', 'Suboptimal', and 'At Risk') using health indicators, medical history, dietary habits, and lifestyle factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 53 columns and 10,000 rows. The target column is the "Current status of microbiota", where there are three columns:
- Optimal
- Suboptimal
- At Risk
The distribution of these classes is:

| Class | Quantity |
|-------|----------|
| Optimal     | 4554      |
| Suboptimal    | 4672      |
| At Risk     | 774       |

This shows that the dataset is imbalanced. The dataset significantly contains Numerical, Categorical and Multivalued Columns.
